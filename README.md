## Design Concept
1. Running tornado for exposing API service
2. After receiving base64 image, pass to a pre-trained ResNet50 model for image classification to retrieve the document type.
3. After getting the document type, create multiple threads to call Tencent/Baidu/Face++/Netease/JD OCR API to retrieve the 1st round of OCR result
4. Base on the 1st round of OCR result, to match against the pre-defined template. Template is created by using the [project folder]/templates/template_generator.html. If template match, crop the recognition area to a new image (idea is to remove those unnecessary information to get a more accurate OCR result), then pass to Tencent/Baidu/Face++/Netease/JD OCR API again.
5. Match the 2nd OCR result against the template fields
6. According to corresponding document type to apply respective data cleasing logic
7. Calculate the score
